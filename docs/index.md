This is the start of a repository for OpsStream documentation.

The markdown files were generated via export from https://app.nuclino.com/OpsStream

Nuclino arranges things into "workspaces"  One workspace is "OpsStream Core Database".  Nuclino generates a zip file for each workspace.

I have created a folder for each of these workspaces, and unziped the markdown .md files that Nuclino provided.

I've then manually created this index.md file.

Hopefully we can find a way to make something like this work...
