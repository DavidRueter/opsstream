Theas (Greek word for Goddess) is a self-contained web application server platform we created and released as open source.

Theas is used to serve up custom screens / custom user interfaces in OpsStream.

In the future, support for the legacy UI server will end, and the native OpsStream UI will be served by Theas as well.
